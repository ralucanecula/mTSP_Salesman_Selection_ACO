The data set contains four Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances taken from TSPLIB (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).
By specifying for each of these TSP instances several values for the number of salesmen (2, 3, 5 and 7), we obtain a total of 16 
Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (multiple-TSP) instances, which are used in the experimental part of our study.
