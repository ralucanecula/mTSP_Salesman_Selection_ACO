# mTSP_Salesman_Selection_ACO
This repository contains the source code for five implemented Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms for solving the single-objective MinMax Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP),
which considers the minimization of the longest tour, and the bi-objective mTSP, which considers two conflicting objectives: 1) minimization of the total traveled distance
and 2) work balancing {which amounts to minimizing the amplitude of the costs of individual tours). The aim is to examine the correlation between the mechanism employed
to select the salesman during the tour construction phase, and the quality of obtained solutions. 
Also, this repository includes the data set, containing the considered mTSP instances used in the experimental study.
